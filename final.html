    <h2>Introduction</h2>
	    <p>The current digital age includes current digital needs. The importance of these needs is shown to us in the form of arising sectors and politics with niche focus. The niche focus I am currently pursuing is that of Cybersecurity. Traditional IT concerns are nothing of a worry when next to real and backed cybersecurity concerns, that is why I strongly believe there should be reform, and I would love to do my part. The more online and open we are as a society, the more vulnerable we are.</p>
    <h3>Abstract:</h3>
    <p class="glitch" data-text="Cybersecurity in the Digital Age"></p><p>In today's interconnected world, cybersecurity is not just a technical necessity but a cornerstone of modern society. Our increasing reliance on digital systems has made them prime targets for cyberattacks, which can disrupt lives, economies, and the infrastructures that sustain them. The 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack, which impacted over 200,000 computers across 150 countries, is a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities that exist within our digital ecosystems. Such incidents underscore the urgent need for robust cybersecurity measures to protect against the ever-evolving threats posed by hackers, state actors, and other malicious entities.<a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2624-800X/2/2/12">Source</a>
</p>


    <h2>Advanced Solutions and Challenges</h2>
    <p>
	Cyber threats have an invasive nature on one's privacy, commonalities in attack methodology seem to similarly call for the stealing of one's secrets being just as valuable as money itself. For context something like a phishing attack where the victim is directed via browser to a fake page where they are baited – like a fish – to enter their private information for their eyes only, is similarly an invasion of privacy as yet another extremely common attack such as ransomware (an aforementioned live example would be the WannaCry attack), this being said the two along with most attacks are intrinsic on ones data, or ones company’s data, which ultimately means there are vulnerabilities in our technology frameworks. According to author Jody Booth in the article "Machine Learning Security and Trustworthiness", machine learning is a representation of significant advancement in cybersecurity whilst simultaneously introducing unique threats from the due respect of rapid development as a whole entity which helps to forget initial disregard for security measures. Booth argues, “Machine learning is pivotal in driving both the development and the inadvertent exposure of digital systems to sophisticated threats, necessitating a balanced approach to technology adoption and cybersecurity enforcement” (Booth 137-222). The perception is quite heavy in its words and rather crucial due to the highlighting of complicated security measure needs which are in a well kept pace with its advancement simultaneously. The juxtaposed pairing of these two points shadows the need for a globally balanced approach that takes advantage rather of technological innovation as machine learning does but as well enhances them with robust security framework to counter the emergence of cyber threats effectively.

    </p>
    
    <h2>Human Factors in Security</h2>
    <p>
	Following the ideals of ML and AI, an article by authors Bibhu Dash and Meraj Ansari titled "An Effective Cybersecurity Awareness Training Model: First Defense of an Organizational Security Strategy", the authors emphasize, the human element often is represented in the weakest link in the chain of cybersecurity. The awareness and training in AI language models which educate individuals on basics of digital safety standard; such as encrypting/securing personal data or recognizing phishing emails are quite critical (Dash & Ansari. 2022). According to the study; “engaging in continuous and dynamic AI-driven training environments can significantly enhance an individual's ability to identify and react to cybersecurity threats, thereby reducing the incidence of breaches due to human error” (Dash and Ansari). An approach like this is precisely effective due to the fact it leverages the adaptive learning capabilities of AI to tailor educational content to the user’s understanding level, thereby maximizing learning efficiency and cybersecurity comprehension.

    </p>
    
    <h2>Global Policy and Cooperation</h2>
    <p>
	While cybersecurity has spread across this nation, it is not often talked about the global aspects and shared traits or problems. Peter Jennings and Tobias Feakin have assembled a quality article titled "The Emerging Agenda for Cybersecurity" outlining the complexities involved in state-sponsored cyber defenses and the widespread proliferation of cybercrime. Emphasis is put on the idea that traditional cybersecurity practice is becoming obsolete (recurring theme). Authors Jennings and Feakin have made very clear the importance of understanding just how divided the vast spectrum of cybersecurity policies is, the key actors in it are often conflicted. The authors state; “One of the problems inherent in cybersecurity is the sheer number of government and private sector entities that have a legitimate interest in the field. This adds enormously to the complexity of cyber policy development” (Jennings and Feakin). The two have spoken in support of early detection systems and a skilled workforce for rather intuitive and practical solutions to help with problem solving capabilities. However, the critique of the narrative is present in the current and modern approaches of security, a gray area of governmental and private corporations contrast, which calls for clouded development. The argument is for a centralized approach overall in terms of managing the complexities to improve effectiveness of cyber defenses. Some may argue in lieu of centralization leading to bureaucratic choke, limiting and flustering innovation and improvements from the broader society in need of cybersecurity (smaller companies and sectors etc.), furthermore a centralized system can create an easier to break and less secure system in itself.

    </p>
    
    <h2>Alternative Thinking</h2>
    <p>
	An ulterior standpoint, that being educational extension, if to progress, must do so beyond tradition, embracing modernity in its settings, and include a rather interactive platform of user engagement promoting better retention of cybersecurity practices, as suggested by author Monica Ricci’s article titled "Cybersecurity Games: Building Tomorrow's Workforce", which talks of the possible endorsement of cybersecurity games. Ricci supports the use of game enhanced learning of cybersecurity to create engaged and effective learning. She points out that “gamification of cybersecurity training not only improves engagement but also enhances knowledge retention rates significantly compared to traditional training methods.” (Ricci, 2017). The methodology of converting theoretical knowledge into practical skills that can be readily applied in everyday scenarios is proven crucial, thereby strengthening the overall security discipline of organizations. Whilst human alterations, especially of behavioral aspects, is a herculean challenge with little alternatives, one being continued ignorance and vulnerability (a clear poor choice in the midst of a cyber attack), which has obviously worse outcomes. Implementation of an innovatively comprehensive educational program which utilizes the engagement of methodological cyber defense within a society.

    </p>
    <h2>Sector Specific Importance</h2>
	<p>Likewise, the authors Boateng and Bruce (2022) point out specific challenges faced by programmable logic controllers (PLCs) in industrial systems of technological control. They argue that “traditional cybersecurity methods fall short in protecting PLC’s due to their unique architectures and the increasingly interconnected environments in which they operate” (Boateng and Bruce 220-244). Notice the presence of a sort of gap focusing on the necessity for continuous innovation in cybersecurity practices that can adopt a modern and complex framework that is ever evolving of modern industrial systems and mitigate potential breaches effectively. The criticized argument of perfect security being an unattainable goal considering the continuous evolution of cyber threats is a valid one. However, the perspective is at fault when it comes to recognizing the importance of proactive security measures. By continually adapting and improving technological defense, as supported by “The Advancements in Unsupervised in Unsupervised Machine Learning for Detecting PLC anomalies” (Boateng and Bruce 220-244), we can provide extremely well done mitigation of potential breaches equating to the reduction of overall cyber risk landscape.

    <h3>internet of things theory:</h3>
	    <p>
		IoT or internet of things, is the conceptual realization of everything inevitably being connected all at once as the consumerist goal of our modern electronics industry. Tariq Usman in the article “A Critical Cybersecurity Analysis and Future Research Directions for the Internet of Things: A Comprehensive Review” has covered this topic well, discussing with his colleagues the critical vulnerabilities of the introduction of expansion stemming from the IoT. It is noted that the increase of interconnected devices significantly enlarges the attack surface for cyber threats. Emphasis from the author is put on the fact that IoT devices (smart devices and such) are not designed with security in mind or as a priority at least, which is destructive and simply not wise. Usman states; “As IoT devices are increasingly embedded in critical systems, the absence of built-in security measures becomes a significant threat to overall cybersecurity. This is not merely about device failure but about creating entry points for a broader network. The inherent lack of protection in IoT devices, such as routers and cameras, increasingly makes them targets for massive, interconnected botnets” (Usman). The passage fixates the urgent need for complex and planned security integration from the onset of device design to managing expanding vulnerabilities effectively. The assessment by the author calls for action for reform in security measures, asking for, once again as synonymous as it is in this paper; robust security measures. Critiquing argumentation of the topic Tariq presents could consist of the economic and practical feasibility of designing all IoT devices with built in security measures and features may or may not prevent technological innovation and increase consumer costs. The challenge of updating and securing legacy systems that are already in widespread use is as well a challenge in the midst of a time when zero-day exploits are even still found today.

    <h2>Cybersecurity Importance and World Disaster's</h2>
	    <p>
		Lastly I will provide consideration of the importance of cybersecurity in world peril, something not often thought about. Third Way, a publisher of a thematic brief “2020 Thematic Brief: US Cybersecurity Efforts” finds and analyzes correlation between the rise of cybersecurity threat actors and the chaos of the economic vulnerabilities highlighted in times of the 2019 pandemic, a time of world peril. The brief criticizes the US for its insufficient measures of defense in terms of cybersecurity, most important during a time when political and social systems were already under pressure. To elaborate, the brief by publisher Third Way notes; “As COVID-19 continues to ravage the globe, malicious actors are exploiting the pandemic and committing cyberattacks for a variety of motives. Nation-states, terrorists, criminal groups, and lone actors have launched cyberattacks and committed cybercrime against large businesses and private citizens, causing devastating impacts to US national and economic security” ("2020 Thematic Brief"). Global crisis brings peril, times like the pandemic can exercise vulnerabilities in cybersecurity, serving as a main actor for threats which bring societal and governmental distraction or peril. The brief also calls for a significant overhaul of national digital defense strategy, putting emphasis on the need for legislative action to bolster defense against increasingly sophisticated cyber threat actors. Opposing argumentation may include that the surge of cyber threats in a time of peril is rather temporary, and related to global circumstance of the event rather than the idea the problem will not be fixed. Suggestions of existing cybersecurity defense measures could be that it may only need minor adjustment rather than comprehensive legislation which is simply never the case.
		<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/resrep26169"></a>
	    </p>
    <h2>Cybersecurity and the Importance of Global Cooperation</h2>
	    <p>
		Consistency within national security design of framework is subject to the possibility of global cooperation, author Samuel Visner questions this possibility and explores the possibility in his article "Cyber Security's Next Agenda" Visner speaks of a narrative of suggestion that while recognition of cybersecurity is a freedom of state and contracted power to have at will, comprehension of utilizing the power effectively for international diplomacy and security is a headache rather. Visner advocates for unification of a global approach to cybersecurity standards which Visner believes could be far more effective than previously unorganized efforts. He interprets this by stating; “The recognition that cybersecurity is an instrument of state power has not yet led to an adequate understanding of how to best utilize it; what interests it could protect and advance; how to deter its use by others; and the rules to which states should adhere” (Visner 89-99). The observation fixates on an array of hinted challenges which harmonize towards international efforts due to varied national perspectives and priorities of many. Ultimately the statement puts focus on a need for a more complex framework of security that not only recognizes but utilizes cybersecurity for state and international diplomacy. The feasibility of international cooperation on cybersecurity is fought with challenges, including the differing national interests, privacy concerns, and the sovereignty of state. Additional consideration could consist of global standards having failure when addressing localized threats effectively.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
	Following an order of epilogue, I will conclude by saying WannaCry is an exemplification of the chaotic pro destructive narrative and potential shown by cyber threats whilst highlighting critical need for organized educational experiences of cybersecurity. Via integration of advanced technological defense, human behavioral enhancement, and lastly policy framework repacking and enforcement, significant strength will be seen in the growth of digital defense. The multifaceted approach is not merely a recommendation however a necessity in the quest of digital future securities and our digital future’s security. Let this essay serve not only as a call to action for the people, but as well a set of instructions…a blueprint if you will for the robust and multidimensional defense possibilities that the digital future requires.
